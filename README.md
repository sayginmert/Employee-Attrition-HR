# Salifort Motors: Employee Attrition - Analysis & Prediction

This repository presents a complete end-to-end data analysis and machine learning project that aims to understand, analyze, and predict employee attrition at Salifort Motors. The goal is to identify key patterns in employee behavior and build predictive models to support data-driven HR decisions and reduce employee turnover.

## Key Objectives

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in employee satisfaction, workload, promotions, and more.
- Clean and preprocess the data for modeling.
- Build and evaluate Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.
- Use cross-validation and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
- Visualize feature importance, confusion matrices, and performance metrics.
- Provide HR-focused recommendations based on findings.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a modified HR dataset representing employee attributes and attrition behavior at Salifort Motors.

## Machine Learning Models

Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | AUC
Logistic Regression | ~82% | ~79% | ~82% | ~80% | ~86%
Decision Tree | ~98% | ~96% | ~91% | ~94% | ~97%
Random Forest | ~97% | ~95% | ~92% | ~93% | ~98%

## Key Insights

- Employees with very low satisfaction levels are much more likely to leave.
- Extreme work hours and number of projects correlate with higher attrition.
- Lack of promotion opportunities and long tenure without recognition also play a role.

## Recommendations

- Monitor and cap extreme workloads and project counts.
- Recognize and reward long-tenured employees.
- Improve communication and transparency around work expectations.
- Conduct regular satisfaction checks and act on feedback.
